== Description ==

**Temp Mail** Make your WordPress site support temporary mailbox service (as know as disposable email, trash mail or 10 minute mail).

Many people don't want to give up their real e-mail address when they sign up for a site which requires that you provide an e-mail address to send validation e-mail to. Because it ended up on a bunch of spam lists. This is nice and disposable. Enjoy!
